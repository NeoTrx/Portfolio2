									<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
										<h4>3D printing hardware and workshop facilities</h4>
										<p>The dragon will be 3D printed using PLA (Polylactic Acid), which was chosen over other materials for several reasons. Firstly, PLA is made from renewable sources such as starch or sugarcane, which makes it environmentally friendly and biodegradable. Additionally, PLA is known for being easy to use with low warping during printing, which means smoother and more accurate prints. PLA has a lower melting than other plastics, making it compatible with more 3D printers and allowing for a faster print time within the university. However, PLA has some limitations, such as being more brittle and less ideal for high-stress parts. 3D printing will allow for quick iteration, assembly, and functionality of the dragon. 3D printing is widely used in industries such as engineering, healthcare and entertainment, reforming manufacturing processes by allowing easy customisation and a level of complexity that would have been previously unavailable with more traditional methods.</p>
										<h4>3D Modelling software</h4>
										<p>Blender's wide range of tools available for free will be a vital part of the design process. Blender offers many modelling and texturing tools to allow users to create models and add texturing to them, which would be suited for a dragon. Unlike other technologies like CAD, which offers precise technical tools, Blender provides more freedom in modelling, making it very good for character design and modelling. Within industry, 3D modelling software is widely used in industries such as entertainment, gaming, architecture and product design. 3D modelling software is vital for prototyping, visualising and production. Game developers may use these tools to create detailed models of characters, buildings and environments.</p>
										<h4>3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities</h4>
										<p>3D scanning offers a large number of benefits across different industries. Firstly, it enables precise real-world object duplication and measurements. Additionally, 3D scanning increases prototyping by importing real-life objects, capturing the details, and reducing the time needed to finish the prototype. The HandySCAN 3D gun, an industry-level 3D scanning device, has high portability and efficiency. The handheld design allows for many different angles while scanning in various environments, eliminating the need for bulky setup and equipment. The easy use makes it ideal for capturing complicated geometries with precision and speed, making it the preferred hardware in aerospace, healthcare and manufacturing industries. Alongside the gun is the VXelements software, a powerful software that makes the scanning process much smoother.</p>

									<h3>Technologies Not Used</h3>
									<p>There was a wide range of technologies available for us to use for the design and development of the prototype. However, many technologies were not used because they did not meet project requirements or were not feasible.</p>
									<h4>Motion capture hardware, software, and stage facilities</h4>
									<p>Motion capture technology was not used due to project constraints and the nature of the project. Although motion capture could have offered benefits such as precise animation, its use did not align with the project requirements as the dragon would not be animated. If animation were used, pretending to be a dragon would prove challenging. Motion capture technology is widely used in games, movie production, and sports biomechanics, where realistic motion capture and performance analysis are vital and relevant across various entertainment and research fields. If this technology were to be used, it could be used for the animation of the dragon to see potential positions or movements to use as a reference.</p>
									<h4>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software package</h4>
									<p>Despite the potential benefits CAD could bring and being a technology that can be seen as a vital part of developing a project using 3D printing, CAD will not be used in creating the dragon. Although CAD software could have provided precise modelling and structural planning for 3D printing, the project will focus on other design methods, such as Blender. Although the decision not to use CAD was made, within the industry, it is used mainly in sectors such as cars, aerospace, and architecture, where it is used for product design, engineering analysis, and manufacturing planning due to its versatility and efficiency in virtual design creation. If this technology were to be used in this project, it could be used to design the hinges or other small intricate parts required for the moving parts of the dragon.</p>
									<h4>Haptic input hardware and associated 3D sculpting software</h4>
									<p>While not used in this project, haptic input hardware paired with 3D sculpting software offers tactile feedback and direct sculpting capabilities, enhancing the default modelling process. This technology was not used due to a lack of knowledge and skill with the hardware, which did not allow time to improve enough to fully design a prototype within the time frame requirements. These tools allow for physical interaction within a digital environment, mimicking traditional sculpting techniques while creating a more immersive creative experience. In industries such as animation, gaming and medical simulations, haptic technology creates lifelike interactions and realistic simulations, showing its potential for enhancing user engagement. If this technology were to be used, it could be used to develop the dragon model or add detailed features to a model developed in Blender.</p>
									<h4>Laser-cutting hardware and workshop facilities</h4>
									<p>Despite the possible benefits of laser-cutting to get intricate details, this project did not use laser-cutting hardware and the associated workshop facilities. Although laser cutting could offer precise manufacturing capabilities, the decision not to use it was due to using 3D printing for the parts needed, as this was more efficient. However, laser cutting is widely used in industries such as prototyping and fashion, allowing for quick and precise creation for a diverse range of applications. If this technology was used, the hinges could be cut out of wood for the jaw to move, providing a cost-effective method to test different sizes and methods.</p>
									<h4>Resin production, postproduction and composite workshop facilities</h4>
									<p>Resin production, postproduction and composite workshop facilities were not utilised to develop the dragon. Despite the potential to enhance the aesthetics and durability, various factors influenced the decision not to use this, such as budget, timeline and requirements. Resin production and composite workshops are used in aerospace, cars and consumer goods industries, where lightweight and durable materials are vital for product performance and design innovation.</p>

									<h3>Development</h3>
									<h4>Planning</h4>
									<p>Many options were considered when deciding what design to make for the project:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Rock – Just a rock with eyes that can open its mouth and make noises when it has opened. This straightforward design would be the simplest to design and produce.</li>
										<li>Purple worm – A purple worm from D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) would wriggle around.</li>
										<li>Dragon – The final idea was a red dragon from D&D, this would be able to move its tail and open and close its mouth with an unknown mechanism at this point.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Considering the time limit, requirements, budget and personal preferences, the decision to design and produce a dragon was reached. This decision was reached by considering finishing the prototype within the time limit while producing a high-quality prototype. Although the idea of moving parts is suggested, the methods are still unknown, so research must be conducted on various techniques. Searching online, binding screws seem to be a good fit for the movement needed on the tail and the jaw. By separating the upper and lower head and adding a square on one side and two overhanging flaps on the other, both with an aligned hole, though, the binding screw can be inserted, allowing for movement of the parts. The same method could be used to make the tail move with one added every one to two inches.</p>
									<p>MoSCoW requirements were made to help decide what functionality it should and could have if the available time allowed.</p>

									                </ul>
									            </td>
									        </tr>
									    </tbody>
									</table>
									<h4>3D Scanning</h4>
									<p>The development started with booking the 3D scanning room to scan in the dragon figure as a base that can be modified and used for the final design. The actual process involved scanning using the 3D scanning gun to move around the object slowly, ensuring the light on the gun is green, meaning that the distance is correct. The gun used markers, which are small images with black or white dots, to locate what the object was on and not include this in the final scan.</p>
									<p>Several problems occurred when attempting to scan the model:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Because of the figure's stance, it could not stand, so it had to be tilted, which meant the underside of the wing couldn’t be scanned. To overcome this, multiple scans had to be taken from different angles and put on top of each other to fill in the missing holes.</li>
										<li>Because the model was made from plastic, when the figure was leaning more on one side, the weight would slightly push down the figure, making alignment much more challenging.</li>
										<li>When attempting to combine the different scans, the software unfortunately crashed. However, luckily, it had been saved just before, so no scans were lost. This is a known issue; saving frequently is vital in case the software crashes.</li>
										<li>Within the software, after scanning the model, many streaks from background noise were hard not to get on a scan. This could be deleted afterwards, but it was necessary before combining the different scans.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>By 3D scanning an existing figure, time was saved in the development process by not having to make the figure from scratch; after the figure had been 3D scanned, an STL of the finished version was exported and ready to be used.</p>
