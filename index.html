									<p>This website will cover the development of a prototype design for the robotic modelling and drone skin module. Firstly, the techniques used will be examined; next, the methods not used will be detailed with reasoning as to why they weren’t used, along with industry uses. Finally, the development process will be thoroughly detailed from the beginning to the end, along with challenges.</p>

									<h4>Planning</h4>
										<p>Many options were considered when deciding what design to make for the project:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Rock – Just a rock with eyes that can open its mouth and make noises when it has opened. This straightforward design would be the simplest to design and produce.</li>
											<li>Purple worm – A purple worm from D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) would wriggle around.</li>
											<li>Dragon – The final idea was a red dragon from D&D, this would be able to move its tail and open and close its mouth with an unknown mechanism at this point.</li>
										<span class="left"><img src="images/PaintPlan.png" alt="" /></span>
										</ul>
										<p>Considering the time limit, requirements, budget and personal preferences, the decision to design and produce a dragon was reached. This decision was reached by considering finishing the prototype within the time limit while producing a high-quality prototype. Although the idea of moving parts is suggested, the methods are still unknown, so research must be conducted on various techniques. Searching online, binding screws seem to be a good fit for the movement needed on the tail and the jaw. By separating the upper and lower head and adding a square on one side and two overhanging flaps on the other, both with an aligned hole, though, the binding screw can be inserted, allowing for movement of the parts. The same method could be used to make the tail move with one added every one to two inches.</p>
										<p>MoSCoW requirements were made to help decide what functionality it should and could have if the available time allowed.</p>

									<h3>Design</h3>
									<h4>3D printing hardware and workshop facilities</h4>
									<p>The dragon will be 3D printed using PLA (Polylactic Acid), which was chosen over other materials for several reasons. Firstly, PLA is made from renewable sources such as starch or sugarcane, which makes it environmentally friendly and biodegradable. Additionally, PLA is known for being easy to use with low warping during printing, which means smoother and more accurate prints. PLA has a lower melting than other plastics, making it compatible with more 3D printers and allowing for a faster print time within the university. However, PLA has some limitations, such as being more brittle and less ideal for high-stress parts. 3D printing will allow for quick iteration, assembly, and functionality of the dragon. 3D printing is widely used in industries such as engineering, healthcare and entertainment, reforming manufacturing processes by allowing easy customisation and a level of complexity that would have been previously unavailable with more traditional methods. The university has many 3D printers with a wide range of materials to print with, allowing for many different print sizes and materials to be selected from when the decision was made. (El-Sayegh, et al., 2020)</p>
									<h4>3D Modelling software</h4>
									<p>Blender's wide range of tools available for free will be a vital part of the design process, making it the perfect tool to use. Blender offers many modelling and texturing tools to allow users to create models and add texturing to them, which would be suited for a dragon. Unlike other technologies like CAD, which offers precise technical tools, Blender provides more freedom in modelling, making it very good for character design and modelling. Within industry, 3D modelling software is widely used in industries such as entertainment, gaming, architecture and product design. 3D modelling software is vital for prototyping, visualising and production. Game developers may use these tools to create detailed models of characters, buildings and environments. (Hosen, et al., 2019)</p>
									<h4>3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities</h4>
									<p>The university has a large room with exceptional 3D scanning facilities, hardware and software, making it ideal for scanning the figure of the dragon. 3D scanning offers many benefits across different industries. Firstly, it enables precise real-world object duplication and measurements. Additionally, 3D scanning increases prototyping by importing real-life objects, capturing the details, and reducing the time needed to finish the prototype. The HandySCAN 3D gun, an industry-level 3D scanning device, has high portability and efficiency. The handheld design allows for many different angles while scanning in various environments, eliminating the need for bulky setup and equipment. The easy use makes it ideal for capturing complicated geometries with precision and speed, making it the preferred hardware in aerospace, healthcare and manufacturing industries. Alongside the gun is the VXelements software, a powerful software that makes the scanning process much smoother, with many advanced tools to streamline the process and obtain a more realistic model. (Haleem, et al., 2022)</p>
									<h3>Alternative Design Approaches</h3>
									<p>There was a wide range of technologies available for us to use for the design and development of the prototype. However, many technologies were not used because they did not meet project requirements or were not feasible.</p>
									<h4>Motion capture hardware, software, and stage facilities</h4>
									<p>The university provides use to the motion capture room, complete with many cameras and mocap suits to accurately capture the movement desired to use in animation or reference. Motion capture technology was not used due to project constraints and the nature of the project. Although motion capture could have offered benefits such as precise animation, its use did not align with the project requirements as the dragon would not be animated. Motion capture technology is widely used in games, movie production, and sports biomechanics, where realistic motion capture and performance analysis are vital and relevant across various entertainment and research fields. If this technology were to be used, it could be used for the animation of the dragon to see potential positions or movements to use as a reference. (Menolotto, et al., 2020)</p>
									<h4>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software package</h4>
									<p>Despite the potential benefits CAD could bring and being a technology that can be seen as a vital part of developing a project using 3D printing, CAD will not be used in creating the dragon. Although CAD software could have provided precise modelling and structural planning for 3D printing, the project will focus on other design methods, such as Blender. Although the decision not to use CAD was made, within the industry, it is used mainly in sectors such as cars, aerospace, and architecture, where it is used for product design, engineering analysis, and manufacturing planning due to its versatility and efficiency in virtual design creation. If this technology were to be used in this project, it could be used to design the hinges or other small intricate parts required for the moving parts of the dragon. (Castellino, 2005) (Yi & Willy, 2021)</p>
									<h4>Haptic input hardware and associated 3D sculpting software</h4>
									<p>While not used in this project, haptic input hardware paired with 3D sculpting software offers tactile feedback and direct sculpting capabilities, enhancing the default modelling process. This technology was not used due to a lack of knowledge and skill with the hardware, which did not allow time to improve enough to fully design a prototype within the time frame requirements. These tools allow for physical interaction within a digital environment, mimicking traditional sculpting techniques while creating a more immersive creative experience. In industries such as animation, gaming and medical simulations, haptic technology creates lifelike interactions and realistic simulations, showing its potential for enhancing user engagement. If this technology were to be used, it could be used to develop the dragon model or add detailed features to a model developed in Blender. (Sagaya, 2020)</p>
									<h4>Laser-cutting hardware and workshop facilities</h4>
									<p>Despite the possible benefits of laser-cutting to get intricate details, this project did not use laser-cutting hardware and the associated workshop facilities. Although laser cutting could offer precise manufacturing capabilities, the decision not to use it was due to using 3D printing for the parts needed, as this was more efficient. However, laser cutting is widely used in industries such as prototyping and fashion, allowing for quick and precise creation for a diverse range of applications. If this technology was used, the hinges could be cut out of wood for the jaw to move, providing a cost-effective method to test different sizes and methods. (Alsaadawy, et al., 2024)</p>
									<h4>Resin production, postproduction and composite workshop facilities</h4>
									<p>The university has a large workshop for resin production, allowing either skin to be replicated or mould creation for plastic structures. Resin production, postproduction and composite workshop facilities were not utilised to develop the dragon. Despite the potential to enhance the aesthetics and durability, various factors influenced the decision not to use this, such as budget, timeline and requirements. Resin production and composite workshops are used in aerospace, cars and consumer goods industries, where lightweight and durable materials are vital for product performance and design innovation.  If this technology were to be used in creating the dragon, it could be used for a realistic dragon texture to be applied over the print. Another use would be to make a mould of the figure and then cast it from plastic. (Abdur, et al., 16905–16929)</p>

									<h3>Development</h3>
									<h4>3D Scanning</h4>
									<p>The development started with booking the 3D scanning room to scan in the dragon figure as a base that can be modified and used for the final design. The actual process involved scanning using the 3D scanning gun to move around the object slowly, ensuring the light on the gun is green, meaning that the distance is correct. The gun used markers, which are small images with black or white dots, to locate what the object was on and not include this in the final scan.</p>
									<p>Several problems occurred when attempting to scan the model:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Because of the figure's stance, it could not stand, so it had to be tilted, which meant the underside of the wing couldn’t be scanned. To overcome this, multiple scans had to be taken from different angles and put on top of each other to fill in the missing holes.</li>
										<li>Because the model was made from plastic, when the figure was leaning more on one side, the weight would slightly push down the figure, making alignment much more challenging.</li>
										<li>When attempting to combine the different scans, the software unfortunately crashed. However, luckily, it had been saved just before, so no scans were lost. This is a known issue; saving frequently is vital in case the software crashes.</li>
										<li>Within the software, after scanning the model, many streaks from background noise were hard not to get on a scan. This could be deleted afterwards, but it was necessary before combining the different scans.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>By 3D scanning an existing figure, time was saved in the development process by not having to make the figure from scratch; after the figure had been 3D scanned, an STL of the finished version was exported and ready to be used.</p>
									<h4>Blender</h4>
									<p>Blender was used to import the STL and make changes to prepare it for 3D printing. The model was split into four sections: the upper head, lower jaw, body and tail. This was so modifications could be made to allow jaw movement using a hinge and save time and risks of the print failing. The decision was to split the work between us to make the process faster and more efficient. The separation of the parts proved challenging at first as the first method attempted did not split the parts cleanly, meaning when making a new face, it was uneven and, therefore, would not glue to the other parts correctly. To overcome this, the bisect tool allowed for an even cut, meaning the parts fit back together perfectly. After splitting the parts, Logan focused on the head, I focused on the body, and Ben focused on the tail.</p>
									<h5>Body</h5>
									<p>The body initially had to be smoothed over to remove any sharp edges and ruggedness; this reduced the quality slightly and made the sharper edge for the spikes on the dragon smoother. Although it did lower the quality of some features, the change could be fixed and was worth the overall smoothing of the model. As the figure was initially designed to go on a stand, a hole was left in the lower portion of the body that needed to be filled. Filling this hole proved challenging, and the first method of attempting to fix the hole was using the fill and smooth sculpting tools; however, the hole tore and clipped in places. The technique to fill the hole was to select all the vertices around it and fill it with a face; using this face as a base, the sculpting tools could smooth around the area to make the hole almost unnoticeable. As the head and tail were separated from the body, both sides had to be filled by selecting the vertices and filling with a new face.</p>
									<h5>Head</h5>
									<p>Getting the head to the desired shape proved challenging; multiple sculpting tools were used to achieve different effects.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Fattening the head with the pinch tool to get the facial shape closer to the desired shape.</li>
										<li>Creating definition with the draw tool.</li>
										<li>Making the frills on top of the head more pronounced with the snake hook proved challenging, as elongating the frills would cause tearing and clipping.</li>
										<li>Cleaning up the frills with the elastic deform tool.</li>
										<li>Elongating horns with the snake hook tool proved challenging due to the horns tearing and clipping when stretched.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>After this was finished, the upper part of the head and the jaw had to be separated, as the plan was to use a hinge to move the jaw. Finally, the holes from detaching the head from the body and separating the jaw were filled in.</p>
									<h5>Tail</h5>
									<p>The tail was split into two different parts to allow the tail to wriggle left and right, using a binding screw to enable movement. However, this was proven too challenging to do as in Blender, the size of the holes could not be measured accurately. CAD tools could have been used to overcome this; however, this was proven impossible with time limitations and a lack of knowledge of the software. After realising this, it was too late to reattach the two tail parts and attach the tail to the body. This was because the parts had been slightly moved and would not perfectly align when attached back together, making small holes that could affect the 3D print, and as the body had been modified, an older version could not be used.</p>
									<h5>Universal Challenge</h5>
									<p>The separation of the parts proved challenging at first as the first method attempted did not split the parts cleanly, meaning when making a new face, it was uneven and, therefore, would not glue to the other parts correctly. To overcome this, the bisect tool allowed for an even cut, meaning the parts fit back together perfectly.</p>
									<h4>3D Printing</h4>
									<p>The 3D printing process involved splitting the parts that needed to be printed into separate STL files and scaled accordingly. The scaling down of the model proved challenging, as in Blender, there was no tool to see the model size before exporting it to an STL. To overcome this, Fusion 360’s tools helped; the measurements first showed around 300mm from the end of one wing to the other. However, when sending the STLs to be 3D printed, the sizes were much smaller than what was measured, and the reasons for this were unknown. Various scaling methods were attempted, such as scaling down based on percentages in Blender and using the ruler tool in Fusion 360.  Unfortunately, these tools could not help, and help was received from the 3D printing department to do this.</p>
									<p>The printed model was printed into four different parts with supports to stop it from falling over when it was printed. The head and the tail were printed slightly too big compared to the body, which meant they did not align properly. However, the decision was made to glue the parts together since the excess plastic could be filed down to make the shape and transition smoother. Although the initial plan was to use a hinge to make the jaw move, time means the hinge will be completed after submission.</p>
									<p>Although initially the model was meant to be painted, only the upper head was painted as a demo due to time restrictions; the restriction on time meant it would be painted after submission, so only pictures of the upper head painted will be shown. However, the painting process will be described. The PLA model was printed in black, meaning painting would prove challenging without a base or primer layer in white; this was the first painting stage. The stages of painting were:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Abaddon black base applied</li>
										<li>Coloured horns with Aandri dust</li>
										<li>Lighter red applied with mephisto red</li>
										<li>Used khorne red for the darker frills</li>
										<li>Corax white for the teeth</li>
										<li>Agrax earthshade for shadows</li>
